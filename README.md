## For incoming graduate students
1. Make sure to forward your employee email (e.g., `tsalo@fiu.edu`) to your student email (e.g., `tsalo006@fiu.edu`), or vice versa. Important emails may be sent to either or both, so it is very helpful to just forward one to the other.
2. Follow instructions [here](http://ircc.fiu.edu/accounts/) to obtain access to the FIU High Performance Cluster (HPC). Most labs perform most of their data analysis on the HPC.
3. Follow instructions [here](https://castic.fiu.edu/main/app/core/helpguides/Papercut-Mac.pdf) to obtain access to printer queue. This will allow you to send your print jobs to a queue and release the jobs on the Toshiba printers on campus using your Panther ID card.
